# Ch. 27 - Interlude: Thread API

* This is an interlude that briefly covers the main portions of the threads API
* We will go over these in more detail and explain further in subsequent chapters, this is more of a reference
> **The Crux: How to Create and Control Threads**
> What interfaces should the OS present for thread creation and control? How should these interfaces be designed to enable ease of use as well as utility?

### 27.1 - Thread Creation

* **POSIX:** An API for OS-level (and user-level) programming, that aims to maintain compatibility between different operating systems
* In POSIX, thread creation is easy:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_create(pthread_t      *thread,
             const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                   void           *(*start_routine)(void*),
                   void           *arg);
```
* There are 4 arguments:
  * The first is a pointer to a `pthread_t` object, which will be initialized with the thread created
  * The second sets some attributes the thread will have, but in most cases we will set the defaults by passing `NULL`
  * The third is in the form a function pointer, which basically says: it expects a function which takes a `void *` argument, and returns a `void *` pointer. But we can specify it to take any argument and return any type. So if it took an `int` and returned a `float`, we'd put `float (*start_routine)(int)`
  * The fourth and last is just the argument the `start_routine` will take
* That's it!

### 27.2 - Thread Completion

* In order to wait for a thread complete, we can use the `pthread_join` syscall:
```c
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr)
```
* The first is the thread we're waiting for, the second contains a pointer to the variable which will store the return value(s). So for the example above, since it's returning a `void *` type, we need to pass a pointer to a `void *` variable, so a pointer to `void *` would be of type `void **`
* If we don't care about the return value, we can pass in `NULL`

### 27.3 - Locks

* Next, the next most useful set of functions in the POSIX thread library are those for providing mutual exclusion to critical sections via **locks**. These are:
```c
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```
* Locks work as they sound, basically if a mutex is already locked, a thread calling the `pthread_mutex_lock` function will not return until that mutex is unlocked again
* So as an example:

```c
pthread_mutex_t lock;
int rc = pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
assert(rc == 0);

int rc = pthread_mutex_lock(lock);
assert(rc == 0);
global_var += 1;
int rc = pthread_mutex_unlock(lock);
assert(rc == 0);
```

### 27.4 - Condition Variables

* Any thread library will also have **condition variables**, which are useful for signaling between threads
* The primary syscalls for these are:
```c
int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutx);
int pthread_cont_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
```
* These and their usage will be covered further in future lessons

### 27.5 - Compiling and Running

* In order to compile, it's quite simple. To start, you need to include the `<pthreads.h>` header
* You also need to include the `-pthread` flag in the compiler command: `gcc -o main main.c -Wall -pthread`

### 27.6 - Summary
