# Ch. 14 - Interlude: Memory API

* In this interlude, we discuss memory allocation interfaces in UNIX systems
> **The Crux: How to Allocate and Manage Memory**
> In UNIX/C programs, understanding how to allocate and manage memory is critical in building robust and reliable software. What interfaces are commonly used? What mistakes should be avoided?

### 14.1 - Types of Memory

* In running a C program, have two types of memory you can allocate: **stack** and **heap** memory. The compiler manages allocation for these automatically for you, but you do need to manually make calls to allocate/deallocate on the heap
* The stack is automatically called to be allocated/deallocated, for local variables for example. They are allocated on declaration, deallocated when they go out of scope
* Here are two allocations of memory in C:
```C
...
int x;                               // Allocated on stack
int* x = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)); // Allocated on heap
...
```
* Technically, the second line here uses both the stack and the heap! The variable's data is on the heap, but the pointer lives on the stack

### 14.2 - The `malloc()` Call

* The `malloc()` call is given a size, and either succeeds and returns a pointer or fails and returns `NULL`
* You almost never input the size of the memory directly, but use `sizeof(type)`, where `sizeof()` is a compile-time command
* For strings, should use `strlen(str)+1` as the size

### 14.3 - The `free()` call

* To deallocate from memory a variable, just use: `free(x)`
* Here, x is the pointer returned by `malloc()`

### 14.4 - Common Errors

* There are a number of issues that can arise when allocating/deallocating memory with `malloc()` and `free()` that can easily arise without complaint from the compiler
* In modern languages, the compiler/interpreter will garbage collect your memory for you
* **Forgetting to allocate memory**: Let's say you have the following code:
```c
char* src = "hello";
char* dst; // Oh no, unallocated!
strcpy(dst, src);
```
* While this will compile fine, at run-time, since `dst` isn't actually allocated, this will throw a seg fault and die
* The proper code is:
```c
char* src = "hello";
char* dst = malloc(strlen(src) + 1); // :)
strcpy(dst, src);
```
* **Not Allocating enough Memory**: A related error is not allocating enough memory, sometimes called a **buffer overflow**
* This would happen, for example, if we forgot to put the +1 in the `malloc()` above for the string termination character
* This is highly undefined behavior, as you don't even always get a seg fault here. Very hard to detect
* **Forgetting to Initialize Allocated Memory**: If you end up using the data that you allocated, make sure it's properly initialized! Otherwise the program will do an **uninitialized read**, and could pull something potential harmful from memory
* **Forgetting to Free Memory**: For long-running applications, forgetting to free memory somewhere causes **memory leaks**, which can lead to running out of memory which can end up requiring a reboot
* The OS will clean up the memory after the program ends, so for small short-lived programs you may be tempted to skip calling `free()`, but best practice is to always do it no matter what
* **Freeing Memory before you're doing with It**: Sometimes a `free()` will be called before a pointer is finished being used, resulting in a **dangling pointer**. Remember, `free()` doesn't delete the pointer itself, just the data it's pointing to, so the pointer is still non-null
* **Freeing Memory Repeatedly**: Calling `free()` more than the number of `malloc()`s on a variable can result in undefined behavior, including crashes

### 14.5 - Underlying OS Support

* `malloc()` and `free()` are actually *not* system calls, but **library calls**, like most system call wrappers that C provides
* They each call a bunch of system calls themselves
* One of these is `brk()`, which is used to keep track of the program's **break**, which is the pointer to the last byte of the heap. This is used to change the heap size as needed
* You can also get memory from the OS via the `mmap()` call, which can be used to create **swap space**, something we'll discuss more later

### 14.6 - Other Calls

* There are some other useful system calls regarding memory-allocation
* `calloc()`: Similar to `malloc()`, but also clears the memory before returning
* `realloc()`: Will take already allocated memory, say for an array, will copy it to a new larger memory region, and return a pointer to the region

### Homework

* Some really useful tools for debugging C:
* `gdb`:
  * Compile with the -g flag with gcc: `gcc -o file -g file.c`
  * Run the executable with gdb: `gdb file`
  * In the prompt, type `run`
  * This will show some information on what went wrong, and where
*  `valgrind`
