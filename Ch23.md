# Ch. 23 - Complete Virtual Memory Systems

* We are approaching the end of our study of Virtual Memory!
* We've seen a lot of key parts of Virtual Memory (VM) management systems, but there are some additional features needed to put together a comprehensive VM system
* We'll cover this by studying two real VM systems, the VAS/VMS system, and that of Linux itself

### 23.1 - VAX/VMS Virtual Memory

* VAX/VMS (or just VMS) was an OS developed for the VAX-11 minicomputer in the 1970s
* It was developed to fit a large range of low to high-end machinery
* VAX had a 32-bit virtual address space (4 GB) per process, with 512-byte pages. So it had a 23-bit VPN, corresponding to ~8 million pages
* This small page size was chosen for historical reasons, but creates page table issues as we saw before
